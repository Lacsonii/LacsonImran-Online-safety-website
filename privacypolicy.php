            <li>Introduction</li>
            <p>
                We are fully responsible for maintaining and protecting the provided</br> 
                Personal Information under our control. We have designated an individual</br>

                We collect, use and disclose Personal Information to provide you with the product or</br>
                service you have requested and to offer you additional products and services we believe</br> 
                you might be interested in. The purposes for which we collect Personal Information will</br> 
                be identified before or at the time we collect the information. In certain circumstances,</br> 
                the purposes for which information is collected may be clear, and consent may be implied,</br> 
                such as where your name, address and payment information is provided as part of the order process.</br>
            </p>
            <li>Consent</li>
            <p>
                Knowledge and consent are required for the collection, use or disclosure of Personal</br> 
                Information except where required or permitted by law. Providing us with</br>

                services. We will not require you to consent to the collection, use, or disclosure of </br>
                information as a condition to the supply of a product or service, except as required </br>
                to be able to supply the product or service. </br>
            </p>
            <li>Limiting Collection</li>
            <p>
                The Personal Information collected will be limited to those details necessary for the</br> 
                purposes identified by us. With your consent, we may collect Personal Information from</br> 
                you in person, over the telephone or by corresponding with you via mail, facsimile, or the</br> 
                Internet.

                Personal Information may only be used or disclosed for the purpose for which it was</br> 
                collected unless you have otherwise consented, or when it is required or permitted by</br> 
                law. Personal Information will only be retained for the period of time required to fulfill</br> 
                the purpose for which we collected it or as may be required by law. <strong>[If applicable, include</br> 
                a description of any parties with whom you may share Personal Information.]</strong></br>            
            </p>
            <li>Accuracy</li>
            <p>
                Personal Information will be maintained in as accurate, complete and up-to-date form as</br>
                is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it is to be used.</br>

            <li>Safeguarding Customer Information</li>
            <p>
            Personal Information will be protected by security safeguards that are appropriate to the</br> 
            sensitivity level of the information. We take all reasonable precautions to protect your </br>
            Personal Information from any loss or unauthorized use, access or disclosure.</br>

            </p>
            <li>Customer Access</li>

                amended, if appropriate. However, in certain circumstances permitted by law, we will</br> 
                not disclose certain information to you. For example, we may not disclose information</br> 
                relating to you if other individuals are referenced or if there are legal,</br> 
                security or commercial proprietary restrictions.</br>
