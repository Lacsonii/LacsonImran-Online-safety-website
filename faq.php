        <h2>What is SMC?</h2>
        <p>
            SMC stands for Social Media for Teenager Safety. It's likely a campaign or initiative 
            focused on promoting safe and responsible use of social media among teenagers.
        </p>
        <h2>Why should teenagers be safe online?</h2>
        <p>
            Teenagers should be safe online because the internet can present various risks, 
            including cyberbullying, exposure to inappropriate content, online predators, 
            and privacy breaches. Ensuring safety online helps protect teenagers from 
            these potential dangers and promotes healthy digital habits.
        </p>
        <h2>What is the purpose of this campaign?</h2>
        <p>
            The purpose of the SMC campaign is likely to raise awareness about online safety 
            among teenagers, educate them about potential risks associated with social 
            media use, and provide tips and resources for staying safe online.
        </p>
        <h2>Why should I follow everything about SMC?</h2>
        <p>
            Following the guidelines and recommendations of the SMC campaign can help teenagers 
            navigate social media platforms safely, minimize risks, and enjoy a 
            positive online experience.
        </p>
            
        <h2>How Safe will teenagers be if they adhere to SMC?</h2>
        <p>
            Adhering to the principles and advice provided by the SMC campaign can 
            significantly enhance teenagers' safety online by empowering them to 
            make informed decisions, recognize potential dangers, and take 
            appropriate precautions to protect themselves.
        </p>
        <h2>What is the role of a parent?</h2>
        <p>
            Parents play a crucial role in supporting their teenagers' online safety 
            by providing guidance, setting rules and boundaries, monitoring their 
            online activities, and fostering open communication about internet 
            use and potential risks.
        </p>
        <h2>What is Internet and Security?</h2>
        <p>
            Internet security refers to measures taken to protect computer systems, 
            networks, and data from unauthorized access, cyberattacks, and other 
            online threats. It encompasses various strategies, such as using 
            strong passwords, keeping software updated, being cautious of phishing 
            attempts, and using security software like antivirus programs and firewalls.
        </p>
        <h2>What are some common online risks that teenagers may encounter on social media platforms?</h2>
        <p>
            Common online risks for teenagers on social media include cyberbullying, exposure to 
            inappropriate content (such as violence or explicit material), interaction with 
            online predators, privacy breaches, and addiction to social media.
        </p>
        <h2>How can teenagers identify and handle cyberbullying on social media platforms?</h2>
        <p>
            Teenagers can identify cyberbullying by recognizing signs such as receiving hurtful or 
            threatening messages, being excluded from online groups, or experiencing a sudden 
            change in behavior. Handling cyberbullying involves not responding to the bully, 
            blocking or unfriending them, documenting the harassment, and reporting it to the 
            social media platform and/or a trusted adult.
        </p>
        <h2>What are some practical tips for maintaining privacy and security on social media?</h2>
        <p>
            Practical tips for maintaining privacy and security on social media include setting 
            privacy settings to restrict who can see your posts and personal information, being 
            cautious about accepting friend requests or messages from strangers, avoiding 
            sharing sensitive information such as passwords or home addresses, and 
            regularly reviewing and adjusting privacy settings.
        </p>
        <h2>How can teenagers strike a balance between spending time online and offline activities?</h2>
        <p>
            Teenagers can strike a balance between online and offline activities by setting time 
            limits for social media use, engaging in hobbies or activities that don't involve 
            screens, scheduling tech-free times or zones (such as during meals or before bedtime), 
            and prioritizing face-to-face interactions with friends and family.
        </p>
        <h2>What resources are available for teenagers and parents to learn more about online safety?</h2>
        <p>
            Resources for teenagers and parents include educational websites, online safety guides, 
            workshops or seminars on digital literacy and online safety, hotlines or helplines for 
            reporting online abuse or seeking support, and parental control tools and apps for 
            monitoring and managing teenagers' online activities.
